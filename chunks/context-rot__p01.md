Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4.1, Qwen3-32B, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on Repeated Words Task Recent developments in LLMs show a trend toward longer context windows, with the input token count of the latest models reaching the millions. Because these models achieve near-perfect scores on widely adopted benchmarks like Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) [1], it’s often assumed that their performance is uniform across long-context tasks.

However, NIAH is fundamentally a simple retrieval task, in which a known sentence (the “needle”) is placed in a long document of unrelated text (the “haystack”), and the model is prompted to retrieve it. While scalable, this benchmark typically assesses direct lexical matching, which may not be representative of flexible, semantically oriented tasks.
 Example Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) Setup 
We extend the standard NIAH task, to investigate model behavior in previously underexplored settings. We examine the effects of needles with semantic, rather than direct lexical matches, as well as the effects of introducing variations to the haystack content.

Additionally, we include a conversational question-answer evaluation using LongMemEval [2], as well as a synthetic task in which models replicate a series of repeated words. Each task remains intentionally simple and is deliberately controlled to isolate the impact of context length alone.

We demonstrate that even under these minimal conditions, model performance degrades as input length increases, often in surprising and non-uniform ways. Real-world applications typically involve much greater complexity, implying that the influence of input length may be even more pronounced in practice.

# Introduction#

It is common for modern LLMs to have input context lengths in the millions of tokens. Gemini 1.5 Pro [3] first introduced their 1M context window in early 2024, followed by the recent GPT-4.1’s 1M context window [4] and Llama 4 with 10M [5]. The use case for long context is compelling: longer context means that the LLM can process more information with each call and generate more informed outputs.

Long context evaluations for these models often demonstrate consistent performance across input lengths. However, these evaluations are narrow in scope and not representative of how long context is used in practice. The most commonly used test, Needle in a Haystack (NIAH), is a simple lexical retrieval task often used to generalize a model’s ability to reliably handle long context. Real applications, such as agent tasks or summarization, demand significantly more processing and reasoning over broader, often more ambiguous information.

Designing realistic long context benchmarks is challenging. Tasks often grow in complexity as input length increases, making it difficult to isolate whether performance drops are due to longer inputs or inherently harder problems. To address this, our experiments hold task complexity constant while varying only the input length—allowing us to directly measure the effect of input length alone.

## Contributions#

We present the following:
 - An evaluation across 18 LLMs, including leading closed-source and open-weights models, revealing nonuniform performance with increasing input length.
- A writeup of observed model-specific behavior patterns when handling distractors and varying question-answer similarity.
- The complete codebase to replicate our results.
 
# Related Work#

One of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating a model’s long context capabilities is Needle in a Haystack (NIAH). While useful as a scalable test, it measures a narrow capability: lexical retrieval. Models typically perform well on NIAH, which has led to the perception that long-context is largely solved.

However, NIAH underestimates what most long context tasks require in practice. Variants of NIAH, like NoLiMa [6] which include needle-question pairs with non-lexical matches, reveal significant performance drops. Other tasks that appear similar in regards to difficulty, such as AbsenceBench [7] which tests models for recognizing the absence of a given snippet of text, also demonstrate performance degradation with growing input length.

Additionally, long context tasks often involve disambiguating amongst distractors as part of the task. One example is Multi-round co-reference resolution (MRCR) [8] [9], which involves retrieving the i-th instance of a specific user ask, amongst similar user asks, in a multi-turn conversation. However, there remains a lack of investigation into the impact of distractors in long context settings.

An important factor in long-context tasks is how input length is scaled. Latent List [8] is a task in which the model must perform a fixed number of Python list operations across various input lengths. Various ways to fill irrelevant context are tested, which reveal non-uniform impact on model performance [1]. For instance, adding list operations that locally cancel each other out degrades model performance more significantly compared to adding print statements. This highlights how the type of 'irrelevant content' matters, as some may introduce increasing complexity with input length.

Similarly, Graphwalks [10] is a graph traversal task in which the model is given a directed graph composed of hexadecimal hashes, then asked to perform breadth-first search starting from a random node. Increasing input length means increasing the size of the graph to traverse through, which increases task difficulty as a result. It is difficult to disambiguate increasing task complexity from input length, which makes it difficult to isolate the impact on performance due to input length alone. This points to the importance of isolating input length as the variable of interest, which is essential for understanding of how LLMs actually behave with long inputs.
 
# Needle in a Haystack Extension#

The classic Needle in a Haystack task involves placing a random fact (the 'needle') in the middle of a long context window (the 'haystack'), then asking the model about that fact.

The original implementation of this task uses a needle-question pair with lexical matches. However, usage of long context in practice often requires semantic understanding of ambiguous tasks.
 Example Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) Setup with Lexical Matching 
NoLiMa has demonstrated non-lexical matching to be a challenge for models as context length increases. This task utilizes needle-question pairs that require models to infer latent associations, for example:
 

Question: Which character has been to Helsinki?

Needle: Actually, Yuki lives next to the Kiasma museum.

 NoLiMa - sample Needle-Question pair 
In order to answer this question, the model would first have to know that Kiasma museum is located in Helsinki, then make that latent association link. This tests the model not only for its non-lexical matching abilities, but also for its world knowledge. 72.4% of needle-question pairs from NoLiMa require such external knowledge, making this benchmark closer to a test of how models handle both tasks at once rather than pure non-lexical matching alone.

Testing the impact of non-lexical matching in isolation remains underexplored. Furthermore, this binary distinction of “lexical” versus “non-lexical” oversimplifies the complexity of question-answering in real-world scenarios. Needle-question pairs exist on a spectrum of similarity, yet they are all classified under these broad categories.

Models often have to deal with distractors as well, which has been shown to degrade performance [11].

Throughout this report, we distinguish between distractors and irrelevant content:
 Comparison - Distractor vs. Irrelevant Context - Distractors are topically related to the needle, but do not quite answer the question
- Irrelevant content is unrelated to the needle and question
 
Prior work has demonstrated that distractors have non-uniform impact, yet most evaluations involve short input lengths and older models. Current state-of-the-art models are claimed to be more resilient to distractors, yet their performance has not been extensively tested across various input lengths.

Another underexplored aspect of NIAH is the haystack itself, which is often simply treated as a means of scaling input length, but this assumes that the haystack content itself has no effect on task performance. If the model is indeed insensitive to the content of the haystack, then varying this content, for example the haystack’s topic or narrative flow, should have no influence on the results. However, this assumption remains largely untested.

We design four controlled experiments to investigate the influence of these factors:

## Needle-Question Similarity#

We compute the cosine similarity between needle-question pairs using embeddings. For robustness, we average across five embedding models: text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, jina-embeddings-v3, voyage-3-large, and all-MiniLM-L6-v2. We measure how model performance is impacted by needle-question similarity as input length increases.

## Impact of Distractors#

Taking a high-similarity needle-question pair, we write four distractors. We have the following setups:
 - Baseline: needle only, no distractors
- Single distractor: needle + one randomly positioned distractor
- Multiple distractors: needle + all four distractors randomly positioned
 
We test the impact of distractors on model performance as input length increases to measure non-uniformity amongst distractors and input lengths.

## Needle-Haystack Similarity#

We use two thematically distinct haystacks, Paul Graham essays and arXiv papers [12], and write corresponding needles for each. To measure needle-haystack similarity, we embed the haystack and retrieve the top-5 chunks for each needle, then average their cosine similarity scores. This process is repeated across five different embedding models for robustness.

## Haystack Structure#

In typical NIAH setups, haystacks are concatenations of coherent texts, each with their own logical flow of ideas. For instance, the original NIAH benchmark uses a series of Paul Graham essays, where each essay follows a structured organization of ideas to form an argument. To evaluate whether this structure influences model performance, we compare two conditions:
 - Original: preserves the natural flow of ideas within each excerpt
- Shuffled: sentences are randomly reordered throughout the haystack to maintain the same overall topic without logical continuity
 
We demonstrate the following:
 - Across all experiments, model performance consistently degrades with increasing input length.
- Lower similarity needle-question pairs increases the rate of performance degradation.
- Distractors have non-uniform impact on model performance with regards to how distracting they are relative to each other. We see this impact more prominently as input length increases, and observe distinctions in how various models respond to them.
- Needle-haystack similarity does not have a uniform effect on model performance, suggesting the need for further investigation.
- The structural pattern of the haystack consistently shows an impact on how models process long inputs.
