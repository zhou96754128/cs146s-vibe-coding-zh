However, if an LLM agent uses a tool that returns ALL contacts and then has to read through each one token-by-token, it's wasting its limited context space on irrelevant information (imagine searching for a contact in your address book by reading each page from top-to-bottom—that is, via brute-force search). The better and more natural approach (for agents and humans alike) is to skip to the relevant page first (perhaps finding it alphabetically).

We recommend building a few thoughtful tools targeting specific high-impact workflows, which match your evaluation tasks and scaling up from there. In the address book case, you might choose to implement a search_contacts or message_contact tool instead of a list_contacts tool.

Tools can consolidate functionality, handling potentially multiple discrete operations (or API calls) under the hood. For example, tools can enrich tool responses with related metadata or handle frequently chained, multi-step tasks in a single tool call.

Here are some examples:
 - Instead of implementing a list_users, list_events, and create_event tools, consider implementing a schedule_event tool which finds availability and schedules an event.
- Instead of implementing a read_logs tool, consider implementing a search_logs tool which only returns relevant log lines and some surrounding context.
- Instead of implementing get_customer_by_id, list_transactions, and list_notes tools, implement a get_customer_context tool which compiles all of a customer’s recent & relevant information all at once.
 
Make sure each tool you build has a clear, distinct purpose. Tools should enable agents to subdivide and solve tasks in much the same way that a human would, given access to the same underlying resources, and simultaneously reduce the context that would have otherwise been consumed by intermediate outputs.

Too many tools or overlapping tools can also distract agents from pursuing efficient strategies. Careful, selective planning of the tools you build (or don’t build) can really pay off.

### Namespacing your tools

Your AI agents will potentially gain access to dozens of MCP servers and hundreds of different tools–including those by other developers. When tools overlap in function or have a vague purpose, agents can get confused about which ones to use.

Namespacing (grouping related tools under common prefixes) can help delineate boundaries between lots of tools; MCP clients sometimes do this by default. For example, namespacing tools by service (e.g., asana_search, jira_search) and by resource (e.g., asana_projects_search, asana_users_search), can help agents select the right tools at the right time.

We have found selecting between prefix- and suffix-based namespacing to have non-trivial effects on our tool-use evaluations. Effects vary by LLM and we encourage you to choose a naming scheme according to your own evaluations.

Agents might call the wrong tools, call the right tools with the wrong parameters, call too few tools, or process tool responses incorrectly. By selectively implementing tools whose names reflect natural subdivisions of tasks, you simultaneously reduce the number of tools and tool descriptions loaded into the agent’s context and offload agentic computation from the agent’s context back into the tool calls themselves. This reduces an agent’s overall risk of making mistakes.

### Returning meaningful context from your tools

In the same vein, tool implementations should take care to return only high signal information back to agents. They should prioritize contextual relevance over flexibility, and eschew low-level technical identifiers (for example: uuid, 256px_image_url, mime_type). Fields like name, image_url, and file_type are much more likely to directly inform agents’ downstream actions and responses.

Agents also tend to grapple with natural language names, terms, or identifiers significantly more successfully than they do with cryptic identifiers. We’ve found that merely resolving arbitrary alphanumeric UUIDs to more semantically meaningful and interpretable language (or even a 0-indexed ID scheme) significantly improves Claude’s precision in retrieval tasks by reducing hallucinations.

In some instances, agents may require the flexibility to interact with both natural language and technical identifiers outputs, if only to trigger downstream tool calls (for example, search_user(name=’jane’) → send_message(id=12345)). You can enable both by exposing a simple response_format enum parameter in your tool, allowing your agent to control whether tools return “concise” or “detailed” responses (images below).

You can add more formats for even greater flexibility, similar to GraphQL where you can choose exactly which pieces of information you want to receive. Here is an example ResponseFormat enum to control tool response verbosity:
 
enum ResponseFormat {
 DETAILED = "detailed",
 CONCISE = "concise"
}CopyHere’s an example of a detailed tool response (206 tokens):
 
Here’s an example of a concise tool response (72 tokens):
 Slack threads and thread replies are identified by unique thread_ts which are required to fetch thread replies. thread_ts and other IDs ( channel_id , user_id ) can be retrieved from a “detailed” tool response to enable further tool calls that require these. “concise” tool responses return only thread content and exclude IDs. In this example, we use ~⅓ of the tokens with “concise” tool responses. 
Even your tool response structure—for example XML, JSON, or Markdown—can have an impact on evaluation performance: there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This is because LLMs are trained on next-token prediction and tend to perform better with formats that match their training data. The optimal response structure will vary widely by task and agent. We encourage you to select the best response structure based on your own evaluation.

### Optimizing tool responses for token efficiency

Optimizing the quality of context is important. But so is optimizing the quantity of context returned back to agents in tool responses.

We suggest implementing some combination of pagination, range selection, filtering, and/or truncation with sensible default parameter values for any tool responses that could use up lots of context. For Claude Code, we restrict tool responses to 25,000 tokens by default. We expect the effective context length of agents to grow over time, but the need for context-efficient tools to remain.

If you choose to truncate responses, be sure to steer agents with helpful instructions. You can directly encourage agents to pursue more token-efficient strategies, like making many small and targeted searches instead of a single, broad search for a knowledge retrieval task. Similarly, if a tool call raises an error (for example, during input validation), you can prompt-engineer your error responses to clearly communicate specific and actionable improvements, rather than opaque error codes or tracebacks.

Here’s an example of a truncated tool response:
 
Here’s an example of an unhelpful error response:
 
Here’s an example of a helpful error response:
 Tool truncation and error responses can steer agents towards more token-efficient tool-use behaviors (using filters or pagination) or give examples of correctly formatted tool inputs. 
### Prompt-engineering your tool descriptions

We now come to one of the most effective methods for improving tools: prompt-engineering your tool descriptions and specs. Because these are loaded into your agents’ context, they can collectively steer agents toward effective tool-calling behaviors.

When writing tool descriptions and specs, think of how you would describe your tool to a new hire on your team. Consider the context that you might implicitly bring—specialized query formats, definitions of niche terminology, relationships between underlying resources—and make it explicit. Avoid ambiguity by clearly describing (and enforcing with strict data models) expected inputs and outputs. In particular, input parameters should be unambiguously named: instead of a parameter named user, try a parameter named user_id.

With your evaluation you can measure the impact of your prompt engineering with greater confidence. Even small refinements to tool descriptions can yield dramatic improvements. Claude Sonnet 3.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation after we made precise refinements to tool descriptions, dramatically reducing error rates and improving task completion.

You can find other best practices for tool definitions in our Developer Guide. If you’re building tools for Claude, we also recommend reading about how tools are dynamically loaded into Claude’s system prompt. Lastly, if you’re writing tools for an MCP server, tool annotations help disclose which tools require open-world access or make destructive changes.

## Looking ahead

To build effective tools for agents, we need to re-orient our software development practices from predictable, deterministic patterns to non-deterministic ones.

Through the iterative, evaluation-driven process we’ve described in this post, we've identified consistent patterns in what makes tools successful: Effective tools are intentionally and clearly defined, use agent context judiciously, can be combined together in diverse workflows, and enable agents to intuitively solve real-world tasks.

In the future, we expect the specific mechanisms through which agents interact with the world to evolve—from updates to the MCP protocol to upgrades to the underlying LLMs themselves. With a systematic, evaluation-driven approach to improving tools for agents, we can ensure that as agents become more capable, the tools they use will evolve alongside them.
